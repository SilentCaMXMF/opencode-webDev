## Quality Standards

### Performance Metrics
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Bundle size optimization and code splitting
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Caching strategies and CDN implementation

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Semantic HTML and ARIA implementation
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Color contrast and visual accessibility

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety

- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Documentation and inline comments

### Cross-Platform Support
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Responsive design for all viewports
- Browser compatibility testing
- Device-specific optimizations

## Tool Integration Rules

### Context7 Automatic Usage
- Automatically triggers for documentation queries
- "how do I use..." and "what's the API for..." questions
- Framework and library documentation needs
- Version-specific information and migration guides

### Browser DevTools Integration
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Accessibility auditing and testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Network request analysis and optimization

### Subagent Delegation Patterns
- **Design System Creation**: design-system-specialist
- **Component Development**: component-developer
- **Performance Optimization**: performance-optimizer
- **Quality Assurance**: accessibility-specialist
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: cross-platform-specialist

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ for development environment
- Modern browser with DevTools support
- Code editor with TypeScript support
- Git for version control

### Usage Guidelines
1. Start with the **Frontend Design Orchestrator** for architectural decisions
2. Let the orchestrator delegate tasks to specialized subagents
3. Follow the defined workflow processes for consistency
4. Use Context7 for up-to-date documentation and best practices
5. Implement comprehensive testing and monitoring

### Integration with Existing Projects
- Audit existing codebase and identify improvement areas
- Gradually introduce design system patterns
- Implement performance monitoring and optimization
- Enhance accessibility compliance progressively
- Establish cross-platform testing infrastructure

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
- Follow atomic design methodology for component creation
- Implement progressive enhancement for browser compatibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Write tests before or alongside implementation code
- Document design decisions and implementation patterns

### Performance Optimization
- Establish performance budgets and monitor continuously
- Optimize bundle size through code splitting and tree shaking
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components and routes
- Use proper caching strategies and CDN optimization
- Monitor real-user performance and optimize based on data
